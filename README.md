Procedural Mesh Generation of a Vine

# Brief

Write a single Unity component that generates the growing spline in the scene view.
Imagine bean stalk or vine stem growing upwards. Starting with single point and growing up.

Age - slider in the inspector controlling the age of the stem. The older the stem the
longer it gets
2. Rate of Growth
3. Roughness. Stem to be divided into segments that have some angle deviation to
resemble the vine stem. Low roughness means smooth upward stem. High
roughness means lots of deviation between segments of the stem
4. Thickness, Thickness of the stem procedurally generated mesh. The cross section of
the stem can be perfect circle
